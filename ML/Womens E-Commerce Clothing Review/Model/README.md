* Vast majority of the sentiment polarity scores are greater than zero, means most of them are pretty positive. Most reviewers are in their 30s to 40s.
* General division has the most number of reviews, and Initmates division has the least number of reviews.
* Except Trend department, all the other departmentsâ€™ median rating were 5. Overall, the ratings are high and sentiment are positive in this review data set.
* The highest sentiment polarity score was achieved by all of the six departments except Trend department, and the lowest sentiment polarity score was collected by Tops department. And the Trend department has the lowest median polarity score. If you remember, the Trend department has the least number of reviews. This explains why it does not have as wide variety of score distribution as the other departments.
